## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of telecom customer information including demographic data, account information, and service usage metrics. It contains features like `State`, `Area Code`, `Customer Service Calls`, `Day Minutes`, `Night Minutes`, and several others that help analyze customer behavior and churn tendencies.  

After preprocessing, the dataset was transformed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare it for modeling.

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- **Handling Missing Values:** Checked and handled missing entries in relevant columns to ensure clean input for modeling.  
- **Feature Encoding:** Converted categorical features such as `Int'l Plan` and `Voice Mail Plan` to numeric or dummy variables.  
- **Feature Scaling & Transformation:** Normalized and standardized numeric features where necessary for better model performance.  
- **Dataset Splitting:** Divided the data into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.  

These steps ensured the dataset was clean, well-prepared, and ready for model training and analysis.
